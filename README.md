## Weight Tracker App: Summary and Reflection

This project focused on developing a Weight Tracker App to address user needs in managing their weight and improving their health. The core functionalities include secure user login, weight entry logging, weight history visualization in a grid format, and optional SMS notification reminders.

The UI design prioritized user needs by offering a simple and intuitive interface for logging weight, viewing progress, and setting goals with potential SMS reminders. Clean layouts and clear labels ensured users could easily navigate the app.

The development process utilized industry best practices like in-line comments and consistent naming conventions to enhance code readability.  Modular code structure and focus on functionality with separate functionalities like login and database management made the code easier to maintain and future-proofed it for potential feature additions.

Testing was conducted throughout the development process using the Android Emulator. This helped identify and fix bugs related to user interaction, data storage, and overall app functionality. Testing is crucial to ensure a smooth user experience and a polished final product.

A challenge arose in implementing a user-friendly database interaction for weight entries. The solution involved creating a clear grid layout for data visualization while ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval functionalities.

Overall, this project effectively showcased my expertise in UI/UX design principles by creating a user-centered interface for the Weight Tracker App.  Furthermore, the code implementation demonstrates a strong understanding of Java programming best practices and essential mobile development functionalities like user login and database management.
